# Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the creation of documentation for GitHub issues by leveraging GitHub Actions. The automation will ensure that a new folder and commit are created whenever an issue is created or updated (only for the first content).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **GitHub Issue Integration**:

- When a new issue is created or updated in the GitHub repository, a GitHub Action should trigger automatically.
- The action will only process the first content of the issue.

2. **Folder Creation**:

- The GitHub Action will create a new folder in the repository under the path `/doc/{issueNumber}-{title}`.
- `{issueNumber}` corresponds to the issue number.
- `{title}` corresponds to the issue title, sanitized for use in file paths.

3. **Commit Creation**:

- The GitHub Action will create a new commit in the repository containing the newly created folder.
- The commit message should follow the format: `Add documentation folder for issue #{issueNumber}: {title}`.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:

- The GitHub Action should execute within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 1 minute).

2. **Error Handling**:

- If the folder already exists, the action should log a warning and skip folder creation.
- If the issue title contains invalid characters for file paths, they should be sanitized appropriately.

3. **Security**:

- Ensure that the GitHub Action only runs for authorized events in the repository.

4. **Scalability**:

- The solution should handle a large number of issues without degradation in performance.

### Constraints

- The project must use GitHub as the version control and issue tracking system.
- The GitHub Action must be implemented using YAML workflows.

## Deliverables

1. A GitHub Action workflow file (`.github/workflows/issue-folder-creation.yml`).
2. Documentation on how to configure and use the GitHub Action.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new folder is created under `/doc/{issueNumber}-{title}` when an issue is created or updated.
- A commit is automatically pushed to the repository with the correct folder and commit message.
- The action handles edge cases such as invalid characters in the issue title or duplicate folder creation gracefully.
